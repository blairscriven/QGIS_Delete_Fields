# Delete Duplicate Fields - QGIS Plugin

Identifies duplicate/redundant fields in vector files. User can select which fields to delete (hold the 'CTRL' button) from a list of fields that the plugin will identify as redundant or duplicates of other fields.

NOTE: this plugin requires the Pandas library to function. Unless removed manually, this library will automatically be included in the QGIS installation.
